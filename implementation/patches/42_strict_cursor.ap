# Summary: This test ensures the patcher's cursor logic is strict.
# It should fail because the second modification's snippet appears *before*
# the first modification in the source file.
#
# Plan:
#   1. Replace "Unique Line", which sets the cursor position to the middle of the file.
#   2. Attempt to replace "Line at top". With strict cursor logic, the search for this
#      snippet will start *after* the first change and will not find it,
#      resulting in a SNIPPET_NOT_FOUND error.
